A plugin for designers to get clients approval on designs.

== Description ==
This plugin was created to help streamline the process of getting designs approved by clients. Here is a list what you, the clients, and the plugin can do:

You (the designer) can…
*With the click of a button send the design’s review link to a client for approval. (An automatic confirmation email will be sent to both parties.)
*Change the text in all automatic confirmation emails.
*Display your company logo.
*Display “Designer” notes for the client to read.
*Display project start and end date.
*Display ”Client” notes to assure the client you have completed all the things they have requested.
… and much more!

The client can…
* Approve designs. (An automatic email confirmation will be sent to both parties.)
* See project start and end date.
* See “Designer” notes.
*See “Client” notes to double check the designer has completed all the things they have requested.
…and much more!

The plugin can…
*Send automatic confirmation emails.
*Display a versions menu to show previous versions of a design.
* Hide notes to show just the design on the design review page. (Especially nice for web designers wanting to show what a design will look like on a page.)
…and much more!
