**This plugin was created to help streamline the process of getting designs approved by clients. Here is a list what you, the clients, and the plugin can do:**

= You (the designer) can… =

  * With the click of a button send the design’s review link to a client for approval. (An automatic confirmation email will be sent to both parties.)
  * Change the text in all automatic confirmation emails.
  * Display your company logo.
  * Display “Designer” notes for the client to read.
  * Display project start and end date.
  * Display ”Client” notes to assure the client you have completed all the things they have requested.
  * …and much more!

 = The client can… =

  * Approve designs. (An automatic email confirmation will be sent to both parties.)
  * See project start and end date.
  * See “Designer” notes.
  * See “Client” notes to double check the designer has completed all the things they have requested.
  * …and much more!

= The plugin can… =

  * Send automatic confirmation emails.
  * Display a versions menu to show previous versions of a design.
  * Hide notes to show just the design on the design review page. (Especially nice for web designers wanting to show what a design will look like on a page.)
  * …and much more!
