This plugin was created to help streamline the process of getting designs approved by clients.

== Description ==
<strong>This plugin was created to help streamline the process of getting designs approved by clients. Here is a list what you, the clients, and the plugin can do:</strong><br/><br/>

<strong>You (the designer) can…</strong><br/>
  * With the click of a button send the design’s review link to a client for approval. (An automatic confirmation email will be sent to both parties.)<br/>
  * Change the text in all automatic confirmation emails.<br/>
  * Display your company logo.<br/>
  * Display “Designer” notes for the client to read.<br/>
  * Display project start and end date.<br/>
  * Display ”Client” notes to assure the client you have completed all the things they have requested.<br/>
  …and much more!<br/><br/>

<strong>The client can…</strong><br/>
  * Approve designs. (An automatic email confirmation will be sent to both parties.)<br/>
  * See project start and end date.<br/>
  * See “Designer” notes.<br/>
  * See “Client” notes to double check the designer has completed all the things they have requested.<br/>
  …and much more!<br/><br/>

<strong>The plugin can…</strong><br/>
  * Send automatic confirmation emails.<br/>
  * Display a versions menu to show previous versions of a design.<br/>
  * Hide notes to show just the design on the design review page. (Especially nice for web designers wanting to show what a design will look like on a page.)<br/>
  …and much more!<br/><br/>
