= Version 3.6 / August 25th, 2013 =
 * FIXED: Additional security check added to the das-header.php so clients can't view other clients projects. Thanks to JetDingo for bringing this to our attention in our [support fourm](http://www.slickremix.com/support-forum/wordpress-plugins-group3/design-login-extension-forum6/possible-security-issue-login-work-around-public-can-view-all-designs-without-logging-in-thread122.0/#postid-564).

(*ie. http://www.slickremix.com/testblog/?post_type=designapprovalsystem&page=design-approval-system-projects-page). So anything containing the word ?post_type=designapprovalsystem in the URL will get redirected to the home page. Additional Thanks to JetDingo for pointing this out. If you want to be able to view projects on the front end we do have the Public Project Board available ($5.00). See [more details here](http://www.slickremix.com/product/public-project-board-das-extension/).

 * FIXED: Project Board for clients, title correction.
 * FIXED: Firefox CSS fixes on default theme and project board. 
 
= Version 3.2 / June 16th, 2013 =
 * SPECIAL CHANGE & ADDITION: We have updated the menu to a more comprehesive flow. In addition we have added a Special Walk-Through of the menu and a more easy to understand way to work the Design Approval System. We have spent hundreds of hours on this new update between only 2 people. Justin and Spencer Labadie and of course the countless others input to help further this project! Thanks to Everyone who have helped progress this plugin, and to all our premium extension buyers… You help motivate us beyond belief!
 * ADDED: Wordpress header and footer are now in the the default and clean theme, this allows for the Wordpress menu bar to be visible and more. 
 * ADDED: Now when projects are approved the signature is submitted to the database and will show up on the project board details. And once a client submits there signature they will not be able to approve that design again, unless you change the approved select option on the design edit page. You will also see the clients signature on the design edit page too.
 * ADDED: A STAR will appear on the row of the Project Name and the version in that project on the Project Board. FYI. For existing users of the DAS we added a meta field so you can manually approve designs if you want.
 * ADDED: DAS Client and DAS Designer are now default user roles. This means when signing up Clients and Designers you can specify that role and they will only be able to access certain areas when logging in. For instance if you sign up a client as a DAS Client they will only be able to view the project board, change password for themselves and Approve a design on the front end. They will not be able to edit posts or anything else. DAS Designers on the other hand will see the DAS and be able to post designs.
* CHANGES/ADDITIONS: Default Theme, modifications to forms to allow for new forced login to approve designs. And ajax submit on Approval Signature. If you use the Design Login premium extension you will get a login screen before the client see's the design. Plus this keeps the general public from stumbling upon your designs.

= IMPORTANT NOTES FOR OUR PREMIUM EXTENSION USERS, You must update all your purchased DAS premium plugins when upgrading to 3.2 =
 * CHANGES/ADDITIONS:  Client Changes, you'll now notice the client requests on the front end submit to database and automatically update on the page via ajax. We also added TinyMCE to the form so your clients can comment with style.
 * CHANGES/ADDITIONS: Clean Theme, modifications to forms to allow for new forced login to approve designs. And ajax submit on Approval Signature.
 * CHANGES/ADDITIONS: The Design Login now looks for existing wordpress users, and logs them in via ajax. This means you'll need to create a user for your client. Make sure you choose DAS Client as the role when setting them up, so when a DAS Client user logs in they'll only see the project board, and there user info. Required update if you are running DAS 3.2
 * REMOVED FROM DESIGN LOGIN: Custom username and password on post pages. Sorry for the inconvenience, but this new method is much more secure. 
 * CHANGES: Roles extension, misc edits to work with DAS 3.2.  


= Version 3.1 / March 31, 2013 =
 * ADDED: Designers can now add there email address to a design post, or just leave it blank and the settings page email will still receive the email notifications. This was added so larger companies with more than one designer, photographer, video editor, etc. on board can also receive email notifications for a particular design post.
 * ADDED: Newly styled UI for the design post fields area.
 * IMPORTANT: You MUST update your Client Changes premium plugin if you have purchased it. Updated version should be 1.5. The Clean Theme should also be updated if you have purchased that. Updated version should be 1.9

= Version 3.0 / March 23, 2013 =
 * MAJOR FIX! Missing SMTP Files. Please Upgrade to 3.0 and your sendmail and SMTP will work.

 * MAJOR UPDATE!
 * NEW: Clients can login to view there designs. Simply make a Wordpress user for them. Once they login they will see the DAS menu with Project Board.

 * FIX: Misc. CSS fixes for desktop and mobile on project board and default template.
 * FIX: Clean Theme now shows Version number in subject for the Approval option.
 * IMPORTANT: You MUST update your Client Changes premium plugin as well if you have purchased it. Updated version should be 1.4
 * NOTE: We are still looking into child theme issues and themes that don't follow general theme structures. If you are having problems please reffer to our forum for help. Quite of few people have figured out work arounds.
 
= Version 2.8 / January 22, 2013 =
 * NEW: Project Board Page. Now your design posts are all organized.
 * FIX: Default Template now has the_content instead of get_the_content. Now shortcodes will work.  
 
= Version 2.7 / January 4, 2013 =
 * Settings Page Fix: MESSAGE TO CLIENT (OPTIONAL) text area field has been fixed.
 * NOTE: This also effects the Clean Theme premium extension too, so make sure and update that plugin as well.  
 
= Version 2.6 / January 2, 2013 =
 * Revised: How the subject field of emails are displayed. This was changed to help people be able to search or sort emails more efficiently. This is the new way the subject is displayed, Name of Design First, Design Version 2nd and the Company or Client name 3rd. EXAMPLE. Subject: Redbull Flyer - Version 1 - SlickRemix
 * MUST: You must also update the client changes premium extension and clean theme premium extension for the changes noted above to take effect.
 * NOTE: If you have made custom changes to either the default template or the clean theme template you may want to save a copy of them before updating or those files will be overwritten.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is the settings area for the Design Approval System. Many options to customize the emails that go to your client and you!
2. Example of what making a new design page looks like for your client to see on the Design Approval System.
3. Here is an example of the theme page that will showcase your design examples. This is a theme so you can feel free to edit the CSS/HTML to your liking too.
4. Here you can see your notes, client notes... Client can approve the design, and if you have purchased our Changes Extension, the client will be able to make notes on the same page... When submitted you and your client will get the changes. You can buy that extension here. http://www.slickremix.com/product/client-changes-extension/
5. Example of the drop down showing the different design versions.
6. Example of header when you click the hide notes button.
7. This will fade-in when your client clicks the approve button. Also once the client approves the design a STAR will appear for that design on the project board, and will record there signature for you to view on the details of the design on the project board.
8. This message will fade in and out once your client types in their name and clicks submit.
9. Example of our Project Board Page. This organizes your client projects and designs. At the end of each project row is the number of versions for that project. The STARS mean a client has approved that design. See the [Full Project Board Tutorial](http://www.slickremix.com/2013/01/22/das-project-board-tutorial/) Here.
10. Simply click on one of the project rows and watch your version(s) slide into view. You can also hover your mouse over the thumbnail to reveal more options.
11. Clicking the details link on the thumbnail will show you the design details. If your client has added comments then they will be appear as well.
12. Create a Das-Client user for your clients in wordpress, and add your clients email on the designs you make and they'll appear for your client once they login as depicted in the photo.
13. We also have a Walk-Through to really help speed things along. This will explain what each menu item is for and give you a 3 step process to create your project board.
14. The second step of the walk through just so you can see how easy we're trying to make this.
15. This is an example of the client changes extension. If you need the option for your client to be able to make comments on your designs, this extension is what you need. It automatically makes an update to the page for the client to see his/her comments without refreshing the page too, once the client has submitted the form. And it also sends an email to you, the designer and the client letting them know about the design comments.
